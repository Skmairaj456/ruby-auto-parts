   🎉 User seeding completed! Total users: 4
   ```

2. **Check Database**: Visit http://localhost:5001/test-users

### If Server Won't Start:
- Make sure MongoDB is running
- Check if port 5001 is available
- Verify your `.env` file exists

### If Client Won't Start:
- Make sure port 5173 is available
- Check if the server is running first
- Verify your `client/.env` file has: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api`
